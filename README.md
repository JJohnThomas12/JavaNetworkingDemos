# Java Networking Demos

This project showcases two Java applications that demonstrate fundamental networking concepts:
1. **Stock Quote Fetcher** â€“ A client that calls a REST API and parses JSON responses.
2. **Guess the Number Game** â€“ A simple socket-based client-server application.

Developed as part of an academic project to reinforce concepts in network programming, client-server architecture, and RESTful API consumption using Java.
